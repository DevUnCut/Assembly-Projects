; This file is the equivalant to a header file is c++
;
; EVERY DLL MUST HAVE AN ENTRY POINT TO THE FUNCTION ! ! !
; WINDOWS WILL CALL THIS ENTRY POINT EVERY TIME:
; - THE DLL IS LOADED ! !
; - THE DLL IS UNLOADED ! !
; - A THREAD IS CREATED USING THE SAME PROCESS ! ! !
; - A THREAD IS DESTROYED USING THE SAME PROCESS ! ! !

; like prototyping in c++ just state the function name here
; If we want our dll functions to be callable from other programs
; WE MUST PUT THEIR NAMES IN THE EXPORT LIST IN THIS MODULE DEFINITION FILE !
