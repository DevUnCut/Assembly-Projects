THIS PROGRAM MANUALLY LOADS A DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY DURING RUN TIME
COMPARED TO USING THE WINDOWS LOADER FOUND IN THE UseDLLs PROGRAM !

BENEFITS HERE ARE ITS LESS DEPENDED ON MULTIPLE FILES WE JUST NEED TO
HAVE THE CORRECT .dll FILE WITHIN THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE PROGRAM
... ALSO WE MUST KNOW THE PARAMETERS AND RETURN VALUE OF THE FUNCTION
BEFORE HAD AS THERE IS NO WAY OF TELLING WITH JUST THE .dll file
