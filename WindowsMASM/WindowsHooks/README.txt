In this program we'll be learning how to use
windows hook procedures, we will also be using
the dialog box as our main window along with
creating a gui that has selectable button and text fields

the HookDLL folder will be used to create our own
dynamic link library which we'll have to build first
to obtain the .dll and .lib files which we can then import
into our main program that will be used to showcase the usage
of windows hooks that will be in the WindowsHooks folder ! ! !
